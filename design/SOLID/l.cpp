/*

The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a superclass should be able to be replaced with objects of a subclass
without affecting the correctness of the program. In other words, a subclass should be substitutable for its superclass without
breaking the program's behavior.

To adhere to the Liskov Substitution Principle, subclasses must adhere to the same contracts and invariants as their parent class.
This means that a subclass should implement all the methods of the parent class and that these methods should behave in the same way
as the parent class's methods. Additionally, any preconditions of the parent class's methods should be preserved by the subclass's methods.


The Liskov substitution principle (LSP) is a particular definition of a subtyping relation, called strong behavioral subtyping.
It is based on the concept of "substitutability" â€“ a principle in object-oriented programming stating that an object may be replaced
by a sub-object without breaking the program.


behavioral subtyping (is-a relationship)

1) contravariance of method arguments in subtype
2) covariance of return types in subtype
3) preconditions cannot be strengthened in subtype
4) postconditions cannot be weakened in subtype
5) invariants of the super type must be preserved in a subtype

// example that violates the Liskov Substitution Principle

#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>
#include <exception>

class Rectangle {
public:
    Rectangle(double width, double height) : width(width), height(height) {}

    virtual void setWidth(double width) {
        this->width = width;
    }

    virtual void setHeight(double height) {
        this->height = height;
    }

    virtual double area() const {
        return width * height;
    }

protected:
    double width;
    double height;
};

class Square : public Rectangle {
public:
    Square(double side) : Rectangle(side, side) {}

    void setWidth(double width) override {
        this->width = width;
        this->height = width;
    }

    void setHeight(double height) override {
        this->width = height;
        this->height = height;
    }
};

void clientCode(Rectangle& rec) {
    rec.setHeight(5);
    rec.setWidth(4);
    assert(rec.area() == 20); // 16
}

// solution

class Shape {
public:
    virtual double area() const = 0;
};
